# Windows Resistor Color Code Finder

## Overview
The Windows Resistor Color Code Finder is a desktop application that simplifies the process of identifying the resistance value of a resistor based on its color bands. Users can select the color codes of the bands, and the application will display the corresponding resistance value.

## Features
- Intuitive interface for easy selection of resistor color bands.
- Automatic calculation of the resistance value based on the selected color codes.
- Visual representation of the resistor with color bands for quick identification.
- Support for 4-band and 5-band resistor color coding.

## Requirements
- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework installed

## How to Use
- **Clone this repository to your local machine.

- **Open the solution in Visual Studio.

- **Build and run the application.

- **Choose the color codes for each band of the resistor using the user-friendly interface.

- **The application will automatically display the calculated resistance value.
